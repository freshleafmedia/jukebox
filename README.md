## Use

There is a single script used to start the jukebox running: `jukebox.sh`. It will do everything for you.

## Setup

### Configuration

All the config options are set when install script is run

### Software

On a basic install of Raspbian you will need to install Apache, nodeJS, `youtube-dl` and `vlc`

These can all be installed using the `install.sh` script. It will need to be run as root.
